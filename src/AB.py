# Based on these results, we would suggest page 2 for moving from vist to register
# We would also suggest either 3 or 1 form moving from register to pay.  There
# is no statistical difference between 3 and 1 in terms of moving from registered
# to paying.  We see that 3 is significantly higher than 2, but 1 is not.  
# More visitors may allow us to truly differentiate between 1 and 3.  At this 
# point is suggestive that 3 might be higher, but this is not statistically 
# significant at this point. We might also use a bayesian method using a uniform prior
# and computing the posterior based on the resulting beta distribution.
