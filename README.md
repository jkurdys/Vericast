# Vericast Marketing Campaign Analysis

This analysis will evaluate marketing campaign performance through exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing.

## Description

Vericast has run a digital advertising campaign for one of its clients, targeting mobile users in the Southeast. The goal of the campaign was to drive conversions -- users clicking through the ad and accepting the client's offer.

Vericast ran two creatives (distinct ad designs) during the campaign: a baseline creative in line with the client's previous campaigns, and a new creative designed to increase conversions by more prominently displaying the offer to the user.  To test the effectiveness of the new ad, some users were assigned to a "test" group that received the new ad during the campaign, while the remaining users belonged to a "control" group.

At a minimum, this analysis will answer the two questions below with all code and output shown, well formatted, and well documented.

### Exercises / Questions
1. What do the different distributions of requests by user tell us?
Please describe the distributions related to requests and the users we targeted. We are interested in both visual and numerical analysis/explorations of the data distributions.
2.	Based on insights from #1, was the test effective? Were test users more likely to convert than control users? Did the new creative increase conversions?
